Odin Project landing page practice for Bayou Eden

Eventually, I will build out a real website dedicated to our tiny living expeience. I used my concept of Bayou Eden for the subject matter of this 
exercise and all photos are my own. This was definitely an interesting and complex test that has left me with quite a bit more confidence in my web powers and general CSS and Flex understanding. It took me about 7 hours of dedicated work to fully complete. This included selecting photos, creating the repo and everything else that went into it. Im not sure if that's slow or not, but I feel good about it!

Thanks so much to The Odin Project for the amazing gift of this learning experience! I can't wait to see what's next!
